# Pollution Under Control Renewal Remainder

The rapid urbanization and escalating vehicular population have significantly contributed to the deterioration of air quality, posing serious health and environmental concerns worldwide. To address this pressing issue, the project proposes an innovative solution, the "Pollution Under Control Renewal Reminder" (PUCRR), which aims to initiate the process of reminding renewal of pollution under control (PUC) certificates for vehicles besides allowing vehicle owners to download their PUC certificates, PUC centers to upload issued/renewed PUC certificates, RTO centers to have access for sending renewal remainders in one click and handle all administrative operations.
